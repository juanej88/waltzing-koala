# Waltzing Koala

Waltzing Koala is an announcement and music management app designed to seamlessly blend announcements into a Spotify playlist. Users can pre-record announcements, generate them using ChatGPT's text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, or make live announcements using a microphone. The app ensures a smooth transition between announcements and music by integrating with the Spotify Web API to control playback and volume fading.

## Features

- **Pre-recorded Announcements**: Users can play pre-recorded messages that fade out the music volume to a background level for a smooth listening experience.
- **Live Announcements**: Allows live microphone announcements with adjustable volume fading (quick or long fade options).
- **ChatGPT TTS Announcements**: Generate announcements using ChatGPT's text-to-speech and play them seamlessly.
- **Spotify Integration**: Control Spotify playback, including basic commands (play, pause, next, previous), and fetch song metadata.
- **Automatic Playlist Resumption**: Announcements play over the currently playing song, and once completed, the next song in the playlist resumes naturally.
- **Custom Storytelling Mode**: Ability to synchronise a pre-recorded story with a matching song duration for special moments (e.g., weddings, speeches).
